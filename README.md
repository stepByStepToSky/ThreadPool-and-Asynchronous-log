# ThreadPool-and-Asynchronous-log
An implementation of threadpool and asynchronous log, each head file (.h) with a source file (.cpp). Because of the simple dependencies between filesï¼Œwe just use source file for test, the implementations of classes are all in the head files.

a) To Compile source files into binary executables

g++ -std=c++11 xxx.cpp -o xxx -lpthread

b) Run the program

./xxx

c) Debug the progma should add -g

Note that the std::cout can all be removed, they are used to debug only.
